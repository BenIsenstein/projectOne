|ROOM THREE - MONK'S TOWER|
---------------------------

New helper friend monk man, and raised platform.

Build epic device - 5 pieces

The monk tells you the message he has memorized for 50 years.

You take the broken jumble of gears out of your bag and look at it closely. You realize the randomly protruding gears and sockets looks exactly opposite those of the piece currently on the top of the device. They are parallel, like continents that have been separated.
