Three consecutive riddle rooms

Each room has a different theme/makeup
- hidden easter eggs
- environment (make use of descriptive narration)
- interactive elements 

Once you complete a room and move on, you'll be unable to go back.

You'll be unable to complete a room and move on without obtaining everything you'll need
to beat the game.
