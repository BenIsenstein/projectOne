Decision: let the map of the game unfold with brainstorming


1hr
---

Do free-association brainstorm for the concept of the game
- concept
- plot
- interactivity
- aesthetics
- ANYTHING


1hr
---

congeal the brainstorm into an interesting, cohesive and informative template of the game
- this should be in full prose, not point-form
- it should describe FEATURES AND UX, NOT TECHNICAL ASPECTS
- the plot component should come together throughout this process

features examples:
- the concept ex. a young woman coming of age, a mercenary losing his humanity etc
- aesthetics ex. 2D, 64-bit graphic, primary colours, backgrounds etc
- theme(s) ex. WWII, French Revolution, Supernatural, morality etc
- motifs ex. a certain sound when entering an ominous room

interactables examples:
- a backpack with space for 30 different items
- a hunger level bar
- tools you can pick up and use
- potential CPU teammates you can meet and have join your party


1hr
----

Write full technical profile of the project
- Google is my friend
- which technologies are needed to implement EACH feature?
- where will I go to learn EACH technology?


0.5-1hr
-------

Re-assess the overview of the project thus far
- Does anything not make sense?
- Are there any glaring uncertainties?
- If yes, what can be done about them? *Do those things*

Write new agenda detailing the order of learning & implementing that makes
the most sense relative to realizing the project efficiently.
