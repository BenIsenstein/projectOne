|ROOM ONE - STUDY|
------------------

There is a hulking security guard blocking the exit of the library on the other side

There are some random people sitting on chairs.

One of them gives you a cinnamon bun the guard won't be able to resist. They're his favourite. It's laced with sleeping pills.

Find a chest with rope and another letter

find 1 piece of the device on north bookshelf

Find another piece of the device in the security guard's lunch box

hehehe
