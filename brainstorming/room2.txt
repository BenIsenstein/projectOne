|ROOM TWO - CAVE|
-----------------

The lone woman in the cave is shivering and wiry. You give her your jacket.

She agrees to thank you by helping you move on

You find 2 pieces of the epic device under rock piles.

Next to the door at the end of the cavern, there is a vertical transparent tube. It could be glass or plastic. It is rooted into the rock and will not come free, nor will it break. At the bottom of the tube is a key that might just float.

Your ally has a bucket but can't reach the canal. You tie your rope around the handle of the bucket and reach the water. 

The key floats to the top of the tube, and you're able to move on. You let your friend keep the rope so she can fish from the canal, and not survive on nothing but beetles.

Your friend says 'This necklace was given to me by the wisest human being I ever knew, my grandmother. She told me it was meant to be passed on, and I would know when the time came. I'd like you to have it.' You put on the necklace, and part ways.
